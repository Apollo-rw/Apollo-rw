I will fix this soon.

And in summary, I'm just a beginner programmer, wanting to learn about the subject every time. :)

I know the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. Every now and then I play with them. :P

I intend to share some of my projects here, as well as showing my creativity.

I'm not familiar with English, maybe there are some translation errors here...

Only that. or no. :)
