Hi! My name is Apollo.

I'm a UI and UX design student, I use html to create design concepts.

I know there are design tools like Figma and others, but I prefer html because I want to create a UiKit :P

I also intend to learn about Android System Source, the AOSP, as I plan to start a company in the future.

I don't know anything about Assembly, C, C#, C++, I only know the Basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (very little) and React. but I try to learn more about other programming languages over time.

Here, you can see some projects, such as a WebUiKit with an authorial Interface, failed attempts to create something functional and even concepts for web applications, or Apps for Android.

Well, that's all for now... Since you've come this far, have a coffee :D â˜•
